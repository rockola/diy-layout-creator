 * 
 * Creates a {@link GeneralPath} with rounded edges. To create a rounded path, follow these steps:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>instantiate a {@link RoundedPath}</li>
 * <li>place a starting point using {@link RoundedPath#moveTo(double, double)}</li>
 * <li>create a polygon using a series of {@link RoundedPath#lineTo(double, double)} calls</li>
 * <li>call {@link RoundedPath#getPath()} to get a rounded path</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Note that the starting point shouldn't lie on a corner of the polygon if you want that corner to
 * get rounded too. Instead, place the starting/ending point on one of the polygon sides.
