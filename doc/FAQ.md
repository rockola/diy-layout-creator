### OSX says that DIYLC is damaged and cannot start (the absolute greatest hit) ###

It is definitely not damaged, do not give up. There's a thing in OSX called Gatekeeper that blocks 3rd party apps by default and as a result they appear to be damaged. It's handled very unfortunately, but it is what it is. To fix the issue, you just need to allow 3rd party apps. Different versions of OSX handle this differently and I've seen many different ways to do it, but this should be a good starting point https://support.apple.com/kb/ph18657?locale=en_US
