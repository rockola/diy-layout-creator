# Brief project history
**Version 4** is the current version.

**Version 3** is the previous version and was re-written from scratch
starting early 2010, but this time as an open source project. It
incorporates all the ideas that were accumulated over years and also
better code architecture. That should provide better user experience,
less bugs and code that's easier to maintain and extend.

**Version 2** was re-written from scratch in Java mid 2007 and is
platform independent. Unfortunately, it's not very fast and is not
backward compatible with version 1 which means that it cannot open
files created with version 1. Bancika: _"It was my first ever Java
project, so code is was so great which is why I gave it up at some
point."_

**Version 1** started its life in May 2005 and was written in
Delphi. As such, it only works on Windows machines (or through
emulators). There's a large collection of layouts submitted by users
for this version which is why it's still kept around.
