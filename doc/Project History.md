<h3><a name="Brief_project_history"></a>Brief project history<a href="#Brief_project_history" class="section_anchor"></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Version 3</strong> is the current version and was re-written from scratch starting early 2010, but this time as an open source project. It incorporates all the ideas that were accumulated over years and also better code architecture. That should provide better user experience, less bugs and code that's easier to maintain and extend. </li></ul><ul><li><strong>Version 2</strong> was re-written from scratch in Java mid 2007 and is platform independent. Unfortunately, it's not very fast and is not backward compatible with version 1 which means that it cannot open files created with version 1. It was my first ever Java project, so code is was so great which is why I gave it up at some point. </li></ul><p></p><p align="center"><a href="http://diy-fever.com/diylc/images/diylc2_screenshot.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://diy-fever.com/diylc/images/diylc2_screenshot-320x194.png"></a></p> <p></p><ul><li><strong>Version 1</strong> started its life in May 2005 and was written in Delphi. As such, it only works on windows machines (or through emulators). There's a large collection of layouts submitted by users for this version which is why it's still kept around. </li></ul><p></p><p align="center"><a href="http://diy-fever.com/diylc/images/diylc_screenshot.png" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://diy-fever.com/diylc/images/diylc_screenshot-320x231.png"></a></p>
