There was an error reading the configuration file and it was replaced by a default configuration.

The backup file is created and placed in user directory under '.diylc' sub-directory with '~' at the end.

This can happen when running two versions of DIYLC on the same machine at the same time.

Replace the main 'config.xml' file with the backup when running the latest version of DIYLC.
